# Music Releases
Project Name: Release Radar

The goal of this project was to build a Spotify mockup library that displays the latest albums from various artists. Each album entry includes the album cover, album name, and artist name. 

### The Problem

The first challenge was to separate the code into different components and correctly import them into the relevant JSX files. After that, I mapped the data from the JSON file to extract the necessary information and display it on the page. I used the errors in the console to guide me through debugging and making corrections as needed.

The main challenge for me was styling the page. Since the styles were in separate files, it was difficult to navigate the hierarchy of different classes.

If I had more time, I would have added the "stretch-goal.json" file to the project. It would also have been fun to add a filter and sort menu. My primary focus with extra time would be to improve the styling and responsiveness for a better user experience.
